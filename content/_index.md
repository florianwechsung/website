I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu) at NYU in the Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing group.
I work with [Georg Stadler](https://math.nyu.edu/~stadler/) on problems related to optimisation under uncertainty.
Before coming to New York I was a doctoral student in the [Numerical Analysis group](http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/numerical-analysis) at the University of Oxford under supervision of [Patrick Farrell](http://www.pefarrell.org).
During this time I worked on shape optimisation algorithms and fast solvers for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

I spend a lot of my time writing software in Python and C/C++ and am a user of and contribute to the [Firedrake](https://firedrakeproject.org), [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/), and [dolfin-adjoint](http://www.dolfin-adjoint.org/en/latest/) software libraries.
In addition, I am one of the main authors of the [Fireshape](https://github.com/fireshape/fireshape) shape optimisation library, the [PyROL](https://bitbucket.org/pyrol/pyrol/src/master/) interface to the Rapid Optimization Library of Trilinos, and the [SIMSOPT](https://github.com/hiddenSymmetries/simsopt) stellarator optimization code.

I am also a consultant for the [actuarial practice of Oliver Wyman](https://www.oliverwyman.de/our-expertise/capabilities/actuarial.html), where I work on generative learning applications for financial data.
In the past I have worked on Weighted Monte Carlo methods for [Milliman](https://de.milliman.com/), and on data driven methods to reduce the energy consumption in factories for [Cambio Analytics](https://cambio-analytics.com).
