I'm a postdoctoral researcher at the [Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu) at NYU working with [Georg Stadler](https://math.nyu.edu/~stadler/) on optimisation under uncertainty.
Before coming to New York I was a doctoral student in the [Numerical Analysis group](http://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/groups/numerical-analysis) at the University of Oxford under supervision of [Patrick Farrell](http://www.pefarrell.org).
During this time I worked on shape optimisation algorithms and fast solvers for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

I spend a lot of my time writing software in Python and C/C++ and am a user of and contribute to the [Firedrake](https://firedrakeproject.org), [PETSc](https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/), and [dolfin-adjoint](http://www.dolfin-adjoint.org/en/latest/) software libraries.
In addition, I am one of the main authors of the [Fireshape](https://github.com/fireshape/fireshape) shape optimisation library and [PyROL](https://bitbucket.org/pyrol/pyrol/src/master/).

I am also a consultant for the [actuarial practice of Oliver Wyman](https://www.oliverwyman.de/our-expertise/capabilities/actuarial.html), working on generative learning applications for financial data, and for [Cambio Analytics](https://cambio-analytics.com), working on data driven methods to reduce the energy consumption in factories.
